# Banking_System
This program simulates a banking system designed to be used by bank clerks in order to add, alter and update accounts in their banking system.  In addition to adding accounts within the program, the user can also choose to load account data from a file.  This program uses a GUI in order to receive data and display it to the user.  The program creates an ArrayList with a default max size of 1000 which acts as a "database" holding the information of all accounts within the system.  The user can than select from a list of possible options relating to their bank which include: Adding an account, Updating an account (Withdrawal or Deposit), Displaying an account and its information, Print all accounts ad their information, Run monthly update on all accounts, and Reading account data from a text file.  This program uses polymorphism to allow for the creation of two different bank account types: Savings and Chequing.  The savings account has unique minimum balance and interest rate fields which allow the account to gain interest every month so long as account balance is over the minimum balance.  The chequing account has a unique fee filed which takes a fee from the account balance every month as long as there is enough money in the account. All accounts must have valid data and unique account numbers.  

This program was created as a culminating Assignment for My Object Oriented Programing Course.
